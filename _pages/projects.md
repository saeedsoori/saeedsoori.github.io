Machine Learning

We improve the peformance and scalability of machine learning algorithms on parallel high performance and cloud computing platforms. 

CA-SFISTA (code): communication-avoiding algorithms  

ASYNC (code): A novel framework to support asycnhronous optimization on hetergenous platforms

DAve-QN (code): the first asynchronous quasi-newton method with superlinear convergence


Approximate Matrix Algorithms
MatRox (code):


Quantized Deep Learning:
