Machine Learning


We improve the peformance and scalability of machine learning algorithms on parallel high performance and cloud computing platforms. 

CA-SFISTA ([pdf](http://www.paramathic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/CA-FISTA.pdf "pdf"), [code](http://squarespace.com/ "code")): communication-avoiding algorithms for high performance computing. 

ASYNC (pdf, code): A novel framework to support asycnhronous optimization on hetergenous platforms.

DAve-QN (pdf, code): the first asynchronous quasi-newton method with superlinear convergence.


Approximate Matrix Algorithms
MatRox (pdf, code):


Quantized Deep Learning:
