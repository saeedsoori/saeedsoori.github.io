## Machine Learning


We improve the peformance and scalability of machine learning algorithms on parallel high performance and cloud computing platforms. 

* CA-SFISTA ([pdf](http://www.paramathic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/CA-FISTA.pdf "pdf"), [code](https://github.com/saeedsoori/CA-Methods "code")): communication-avoiding algorithms for high performance computing. 

* ASYNC ([pdf](http://www.paramathic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/CA-FISTA.pdf "pdf"), [code](https://github.com/saeedsoori/CA-Methods "code")): A novel framework to support asycnhronous optimization on hetergenous platforms.

* DAve-QN ([pdf](http://www.paramathic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Dave-QN.pdf "pdf"), [code](https://github.com/DAve-QN/source "code")): the first asynchronous quasi-newton method with superlinear convergence.

* EFF-RES ([pdf](http://www.paramathic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Eff-res.pdf "pdf")): efficient distributed
algorithms for computing effective resistances in undirected networks.


## Approximate Matrix Algorithms

* MatRox ([pdf](http://www.paramathic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MatRox.pdf "pdf"), [code](https://github.com/kobeliu85/MatRox_RU "code")): high-performance framework to efficiently compress and approximate the matrix computations while satisfying user-specific accuracies.
